I’m `Julian`. I live in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and am a graduate of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (Geography & Environmental Systems MS & BA + GIS Certificate with Distinction).

During my time as an undergraduate, I worked as a research assistant on various projects and served as a lab proctor; as a graduate student I mentored undergrads in my advisor (Dr. Chris Hawn)’s lab. I also held several internships, including at the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Risk Assessment Division.

My expertise is in `data science` (GIS, statistics, AI/ML), but I also have background in social science, public policy, and biology.
